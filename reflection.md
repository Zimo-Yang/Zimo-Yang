# Project Reflection: Building an Interactive "Vault"

During the past few weeks, I undertook one of my most challenging and rewarding projects to date - designing and building an interactive "valut" system using Arduino. 
The goal was to create a functioning security vault prototype that required users to complete various tasks like tapping NFC cards, playing a mini-game with a joystick, and entering a code from an LCD display to open the door with a servo motor.

Integrating all of the different hardware components - the NFC reader, joystick, LCD, servo motor, and more - was by far the most difficult aspect of this project. 
I had to carefully write C++ code to ensure the Arduino microcontroller could properly communicate with each individual device as well as synchronize everything to work seamlessly together. 
At times, it felt like herding cats trying to debug why one component wouldn't respond or function properly.

I'm proud that after many iterations, I was ultimately able to create a fully functioning prototype "vault" system. 
Seeing the physical hardware accomplish the desired tasks through the code I wrote was extremely rewarding. 
This project really tested my skills at problem-solving, time management, and attention to detail. I learned so much about electronics, programming, and bringing disparate systems into harmony.

Moving forward, I'm interested in building upon what I learned to create more advanced interactive robots. 
My goal is to design a basic educational robot for my final project that could help younger students learn programming concepts. 
Building upon my experience with the "valt", I hope to develop strong robotics skills that will serve me well in my future career. 
There is certainly more for me to learn, but I'm excited to continue challenging myself with new engineering projects.
