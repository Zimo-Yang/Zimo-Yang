#Zimo Yang

About: Zimo Yang is a student at [St. Andrew's College](www.sac.on.ca), located just outside of Toronto. He is interested in Computer Engineering with a passion for exploring how technology can solve real-world problems. 
In his spare time, Zimo enjoys learning new coding languages and developing his own apps and programs. He finds the field of computer science endlessly fascinating and is always eager to learn more.

Throughout high school, Zimo challenged himself by taking the most difficult STEM-focused courses available. 
He consistently earned top grades and was active in his school's Aerospace Engineering Club. 
This early hands-on experience reinforced his interest in computer engineering and prepared him well for university level work.

Now in his second year, Zimo remains dedicated to his studies while also making time for extracurricular activities. 
He volunteers doing tech support for a local after-school program. 
His goal after graduation is to work as an aerospace engineer at a top tech company where he can apply his knowledge and continuously push the boundaries of what is possible with coding and design.
